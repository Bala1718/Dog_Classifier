# Dog Breed Classifier

This project is the main applications of Convolution Neural Networks where the main aim of the project is to build a pipeline to process real world images .
Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify the canine's breed.
Given an image of an human, it will resemble the breed of dog.
